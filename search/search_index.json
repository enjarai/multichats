Alliances is a custom system to help manage cities and player groups. For example: you could have a city where the major owns an alliance, and all the people living in the city are part of it. Or you and your mates could have a base together, and you want to make clear that you're all part of a group. Benefits This brings us to the benefits of having an alliance. At the moment there are only two, but that may expand later: A private chatroom in the ingame chat. Your primary alliance name next to your name in the tablist. A home location you can teleport to from anywhere. (Only if your alliance has more than 3 primary members ) Joining an alliance To join an alliance, you have to receive an invite from an alliance owner or manager. So if you see an alliance you want to join, asking around for a bit will generally get you in if they're accepting new members. You can join as many alliances as you want, but some might not accept you if you're gonna two-time them. If you do join multiple alliances, the one that shows up next to your name in the tab menu is decided by your primary alliance setting. This can be configured using the /alliance primary set <name> command, Or you can reset it to the default with /alliance primary reset . For more info, check out the general command reference , chatrooms basics and primary alliance pages. Creating an alliance Creating an alliance is as easy as using the command /alliance create <name> where the name is the name people will use to interact with your alliance (not the display name). Since this is the name people will have to type every time they run commands to do with your alliance, it should be short, simple and without punctuation or capitalization. Keep in mind that this cannot be changed later and you can only own one alliance per player . Further info on alliance ownership can be found at this page .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"Welcome to the alliances wiki.

It is recommended to only create an alliance if you have or are planning to create a form of ingame player group. Staff might at any time delete alliances that aren't used for this purpose. Cosmetics After you've created your alliance you can start customizing it. You have several options for visual customization: The display name and the short display name. The normal display name is the alliance name with punctuation, capitalization and custom formatting like colors. It shows up in a bunch of places like command responses and the tab menu. The short display name is just a shorter version of the normal display name, it should be about one to three characters long and clear to belong to your alliance at a glance. This also supports formatting. To set your display name and short display name use /alliance modify displayName \"<name>\" and /alliance modify displayNameShort \"<name>\" respectively, the quotes around the name are important if you want to use custom formatting. The Message Prefix As discussed here , having a message prefix is a very convenient thing for alliance members. By default, an alliance has no message prefix set. Thus, it's a good idea to set one right away. A message prefix should be less than 4 characters long, easy to type quickly, and unique to your alliance. It also cannot contain any special characters. Recommended format is something like AU if your alliance is called Among Us . When applied, a : is automatically appended to the end of the prefix. Meaning if you set your prefix to AU , players would use AU:This is message to send a message to your chat. Managers For larger alliances, an alliance owner can assign certain members to be managers. These members can send invites and kick other members on the owner's behalf. If you decide to add managers to your alliance, make sure you trust them. Managers can't change any alliance settings.","title":"Alliance Ownership"},{"location":"alliance-ownership/#alliance-ownership","text":"Creating an alliance is covered on the homepage .
